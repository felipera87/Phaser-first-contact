# What is this project?

This is a web mini-game example, my first contact with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3). It's a free [quick course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0) from youtube. It's not a complete game, it's just an example of some features that Phaser 3 provides.

# How to run this?

Need to have NodeJS installed, open a terminal on the project folder:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Then type `http://localhost:3000` on a browser URL.
